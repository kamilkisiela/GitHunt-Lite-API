## Add auth context

Let's talk about resolvers before explaining what the context is.

An example resovler:

```ts
{
  currentUser(root, args, context) {
    return SOMETHING;
  }
}
```

GraphQL as the name says, is a graphq. It means that all the branches and leafs are resolved one by one, from root to the edge.

This way we get the first argument, the `root`. It contains the previous object.

The next argument is an object that holds the query's `arguments`. An example:

```ts
{
  user(id: Int!): User
}

{
  user(root, args, context) {
    return getUserById(args.id);
  }
}
```

The last argument is the `context`. You define the context while creating a GraphQL endpoint.

Take a look at the commit.

We have the `auth` object that was defined before. In `api/index.js` I added a filed called `context` with this `auth` variable.

With this, we can now use auth context inside the resolver.
