# [Step 17](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/GitHunt-Lite-API/tree/step17)

## Check if user is logged in

We want to make the mutation more secure. We should prevent the not logged in user from submiting a repository.

Take a look at the commit.

We simply use conditional statement and an `Error` that is thrown if needed.

This gets to the GraphQL server and resolver know that error happened so in return you will get proper information about this. 
I'm explaining it in the client part of the workshop :)
