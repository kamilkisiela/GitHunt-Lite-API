## Define User type

As we already know, GraphQL is strongly typed.

Let's create our the first type.

We'll call it `User`.

```graphql
type User {
}
```

Now let's add `login` field, that is a string:


```graphql
type User {
  login: String!
}
```

Exclamation mark means that this field is required, not optional!

Take a look at the commit. I put the `User` type inside newly created file `api/schema.js`.
