## Add entry query

We can get the feed but what about a single entry?

Let's add query below to the `Query` Type:

```
entry (repoFullName: String!): Entry
```

and a resolver:

```
{
  entry(root, args, context) {
    return context.Entries.getByRepoFullName(args.repoFullName);
  }
}
```

This way we'll get just one entry based on the `repoFullName` which represents a name of a repository combined with a owner (`owner/name`).

It's now possible to create a query like this:

```graphql
{
  entry(repoFullName: "meteor/meteor") {
    postedBy
    repository {
      name
      owner
    }
  }
}
```
