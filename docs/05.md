## Create a resolver

GraphQL server knows how data looks like but how can we now provide some values?

Here comes resolvers.

It's a group of functions that return values for Types and Queries. Also for mutations but we will talk about it later.

We have the `Query` type that returns `currentUser` field.

How would the resolver for it look like?

```ts
{
  Query: {
    currentUser() {
      return {
        login: 'foo'
      };
    }
  }
}
```

Take a look at the commit. I did the same thing there.

GraphQL server looks for the resolver and expects some value.

Now if you would to GraphiQL (*/graphiql*) and type:

```graphql
{
  currentUser {
    login
  }
}
```

You will get:

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "currentUser": {
      "login": "foo"
    }
  }
}
```

I used "would" instead of "will" because we haven't plugged in the schema to GraphQL server yet. But if we did it would work :)
