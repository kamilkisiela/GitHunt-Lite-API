## Define submitRepository mutation

We're going to create our first mutation.

We focues on data fetching but let's talk about manipulating that data.

REST server has `POST` and `PATCH` requests to modify server-side data.
You can think about mutation in the same way expect one thing. The result of the modification.

With mutations, you can specify the structure of the result. Just like in queries!
We will show in the client-side part of the workshop how this could be really useful.

We need a mutation called `submitRepository`. To submit a repository we need the full name of it.

This is how mutation would look like:

```graphql
submitRepository (repoFullName: String!): Entry
```

Yet again, let's move GraphQL schema language to be more like TypeScript:

```
class Mutation {
  submitRepository(repoFullName: string): Entry
}
```

It doesn't help a lot because GraphQL by itself is sooo easy to understand so it's the last time I do this, I promise!

Just like with queries, I defined global Type `Mutation` to hold all the mutations in one place. And I created an empty resolver.
