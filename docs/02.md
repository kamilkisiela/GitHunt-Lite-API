## Set up GraphiQL

First, what is the Graph**i**QL? It's a in-browser IDE for GraphQL.

It means that when you enter some page you can look up available queries and mutations. Do actions, manipulate the data, fetch the data etc.

With GraphQL Server Express, it's super simple to implement it in a server.

Take a look at the commit.

I defined a new route `/graphiql` and provided the `graphiqlExpress` function as a callback.
I also specified the graphql endpoint so GraphiQL could get data from.

You can now visit `http://localhost:5300/graphiql` to see play with GraphQL.
