## Set up GraphQL endpoint

We're going to use `graphql-server-express` package.

But you can use any package you want, client's side works completely independently from server.
Basically any client will work with any server.

Big advantage of `graphql-server-*` packages over the other packages is that it supports many popular JavaScript web servers,  including Express, Connect, Hapi, and Koa.

Also, `graphql-server-*` supports Query Batching!

I chose to use Express as a web server.

We're going to keep GraphQL endpoint under `/graphql`.

Take a look at the commit.

I added `graphqlExpress` from `graphql-server-express` as a callback function of `/graphql` route.
As you can see I provided an empty object. We will change it in one of the future steps.

With all that, your GraphQL server is running. There's still no data but it's running :)
