## Define Entry type with basic fields

We're going to define the `Entry` Type. It represents the repository submitted by user.

Take a look at the commit.

I defined the `Entry` Type with:

- `createdAt` to keep the date of creation
- `postedBy` to save an author
- `id` that works like any other id field

Let's go to the resolver. Do you remember what I said about GraphQL being a graphq?

We can take advantage of it and use the data that already has been resolved. Well... it hasn't been resolved yet because we're in the middle of creating the schema so we will resolve it in next steps.

But you get the idea. We will use data from the previous object, instead of fetching it again.

As you probably noticed, we defined just two out of three fields. Important to know, GraphQL Tools will take from the result values with the same name as provided by schema. It means that `id` will be resolved automaticaly.
