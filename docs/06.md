## Make schema executable

We have a schema, we have a server, how to connect those two?

GraphQL server expects an instance of `GraphQLSchema`.

We have a string written in GraphQL schema language so we need to convert it somehow.

We will need a package called `graphql-tools`. You can use any package you want, I recommend you to use this.

What is `graphql-tools`? It's an opinionated structure for how to build a GraphQL schema and resolvers in JavaScript.
It's not necessarily for everyone, but it can be a great way to get a server up and running with a very clear separation of concerns.


Back to schema. We will use `makeExecutableSchema` function to create GraphQLSchema instance from the string.

We should also put there our resolvers.

Take a look at the commit to see how to do it.
