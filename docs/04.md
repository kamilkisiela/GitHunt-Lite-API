## Define the currentUser query and a root query

We created a Type, let's now create our first query.

We'll call it `currentUser` because it will get the currently logged in user.

Take a look at the commit.

I created a Type called `Query` that contains a query called `currentUser`. This query returns an object of type `User`.

Image as it would be a method in TypeScript:

```ts
interface Query {
  currentUser(): User;
}
```

I defined the root schema and included query.

Now the GraphQL server sees the query.
