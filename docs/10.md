## Add Entry with feed to the main schema

We have the `Entry` Type with proper resolver. Now let's create a field called `feed`.
It represents a list of entries.

Take a look at the commit.

`feed: [Entry]` means that it's an array of Entry typed objects.

I created a resolver that uses `context.Entry`.

You can see how easily I added the Entry class to the GraphQL's context.

The schema provided to `makeExecutableSchema` function must be a one-level array. The resolvers also should be merged into just one object.

Now you can go to GraphiQL and query the feed :)
