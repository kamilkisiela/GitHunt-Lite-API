## Define submitComment mutation

We're going to create a mutation called `submitComment`.

It receives two arguments:

- `repoFullName` to bound comment with an entry
- `commentContent` with the actual comment's contents


Looks like this:

```graphql
submitComment (repoFullName: String!, commentContent: String!): Comment
```
